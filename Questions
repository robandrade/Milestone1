Hello I think that the most challenging part about Milestone 1, was how I was going to set up the shop and what how will the flow work when being ran. 
I learned the most about objects and how to use them to pass arguements and calling methods in different classes, I think this is such a great thing to have when creating programs because it keeps it organized.
I would like to improve my project by knowing how to create the salable products in the salable product class but as an array, because I think that will improve my code more, and keep from being all over the place.
I think I can use what I learned by separating the salable products and inventory is to keep everything organized so I won't get confused when a customer purchases an item from the shop. I feel that's a big problem
in any workspace. The job I have now, we sometimes have problems on what got bought and how many things we have of that one item in stock/inventory.
